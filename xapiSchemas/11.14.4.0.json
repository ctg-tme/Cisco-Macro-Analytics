You choose which method to use in the Video Input Miracast Transport setting. Both methods support only the 2.4 GHz band, and use TCP port 7236 for signaling (RTSP) when establishing the connection. In addition, when the connection is via infrastructure, the MS-MICE protocol uses TCP port 7250. For more information about the MS-MICE protocol, refer to Microsoft's documentation. When Miracast is turned on, the video device emits a beacon that near-by devices can pick up (range in the order of 100 meter). The broadcast name that appears in the near-by devices' scan lists depends on the configuration. To be sure not to include any PII (personal identifiable information), you can specifically set a broadcast name with the SystemUnit BroadcastName setting. Otherwise, the scan lists will include the Webex DisplayName if the device is registered to the Webex cloud service, and the SystemUnit Name if registered to an on-premises service. If neither of these names are set, the product type (id) will be displayed. When the connection is via infrastructure, the beacon also contains the video device's IP address and hostname. Because Miracast is using Wi-Fi, it is not supported by non-radio devices. Also, you must remember to connect the Wi-Fi antennas on those products where they are optional.
